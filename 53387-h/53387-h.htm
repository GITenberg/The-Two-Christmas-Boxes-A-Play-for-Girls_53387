<div class="adtitle1">TWO PLAYS FOR BOYS</div>

<p class="center">By SEYMOUR S. TIBBALS.<br />
—————————</p>

<p>Mr. Tibbals has been unusually successful in furnishing
boys’ plays that introduce characters true to
life. While the plays are strong and forceful in the
lessons they teach, clean comedy predominates and
the boys like them.</p>


<div class="adtitle2">“The Millionaire Janitor”</div>

<p>A comedy in two acts. Here is a rollicking play
for eight or more boys with plenty of action. Just
the thing for a Boys’ Class or Junior Y. M. C. A.
Easily staged and costumed. Opportunity for introduction
of musical numbers and recitations. By introducing
such features the play may be used for
an entire evening’s entertainment.</p>

<div class="adtitle3">
<b>Price 25 Cents</b><br />
</div>

<div class="center">—————————</div>
<div class="adtitle2">“Up Caesar’s Creek”</div>

<p>A splendid play for any number of boys. The
characters are real boys and the play deals with their
experiences while camping up Caesar’s Creek the performance
closing with a minstrel show in camp. Costumes
and scenery are not elaborate and the play may
be produced on any stage.</p>

<p>The members of the Aid Society wear plain, rather
old-fashioned street dresses, with the exception of Miss
Loomis, whose dress should be so old-fashioned as to be
amusing. In the first scene Mrs. Banks wears a plain
house dress with white apron. Mrs. David Brown should
be dressed neatly but plainly, and Dorothy wears shirtwaist
and skirt. Mrs. Worthington should appear in an
elaborate negligee, and Gladys in a pretty house dress,
while Marie wears black dress, white apron and cap.
Mildred wears sweater, cap and dark skirt. Beneath the
sweater is worn a middy blouse.</p>

<p>The first and last scenes take place in Mrs. Banks’ sitting
room. A few chairs, a bookcase, pictures and table
will be required, also two wooden boxes, exactly alike.</p>

<p>In the second scene a poorly furnished kitchen or living
room is represented. Plain wood chairs should be
used, while a red cover should be upon the table. Mrs.
Brown should have a large mending basket beside her.
The Christmas box should be in the foreground.</p>

<p>The third scene should represent the living room of
an apartment, and should be as handsomely furnished
as possible. The Christmas box should be at the side
of the room, but before unpacking, should be drawn into
the foreground.</p>

<h2>The Two Christmas Boxes.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SCENE I.</h2>


<p>(<i>Mrs. Banks enters carrying large pile of
clothing, which she deposits upon a chair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> Dear me, that was heavy! Now for the
newspapers.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit and returns with newspapers which she places
on a table near the pile of clothing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Now I have twine all ready and scissors, and
everything but the folks to do the work. It’s the same
way in every church. A few are willing to do all the
work and the rest are all willing to have them. There
comes Martha Jenkins now!</p>

<p>(<i>Hurriedly straightens sofa cushion, changes position
of chairs, smoothes hair.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Mrs. Jenkins.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>effusively</i>). Well, Martha, I am glad to
see you! I began to think that not a soul was coming
to help me pack the missionary box. Take off your
things!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Jenkins.</i> Thank you. (<i>Removes hat, gloves and
coat.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> What a pretty waist! Did you buy it ready
made?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> New! No indeed! I made that out of last
year’s and the one before that pieced together. John has
read an article about how you can make nice dresses out
of stuff you have in the rag bag, so he says I’m just as
smart as the woman that wrote that article, and he wanted
me to try it. (<i>sits</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> Well, William did say something about
that to me, so I suppose he read the same article, so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
said all right, but I’d have to economize on him too. I’d
cut off the tops of his socks for wristlets for cold weather,
and I’d make neckties out of Mildred’s hairbows for him,
and I’d try to make over his old frock coat into a sack
coat to wear to the store on week days, so that silenced
him all right!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Jenkins.</i> There’s really no reason for economy
being an exclusively feminine virtue.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>Taking up several of the articles from the
pile of clothing</i>). These things look as if somebody had
been economizing all right.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>placing newspaper carefully in the bottom of
the box</i>). Suppose we get busy now and pack the box.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). I don’t believe any of the others
are coming.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Emmeline Miller told me she couldn’t come on
account of domestic affliction.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). How terrible! What was it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Her husband’s mother and two aunts have
come to spend a week, and Emmeline said if that wasn’t
domestic affliction she didn’t know what was!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Well we can soon get the box packed. Here’s
a nice overcoat! (<i>Holds it up.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Marcia Hill sent that. The sleeves are a bit
raggedy and the lining is torn quite badly but the missionary’s
wife can fix it. They say that’s one of the
qualifications of a missionary’s wife to be able to do anything.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> I’ll fold it and wrap it and you can put it in
the box. (<i>folds coat, wraps in paper. Hands to Mrs.
Jenkins who places it in the box</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> I’m going to give this white shawl. (<i>Holds
up shawl.</i>) It really ought to be cleaned or washed but
I simply haven’t the time. You know how busy everyone
is just before Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> O that can easily be cleaned in cornmeal or
flour or gasoline, I forget which, (<i>aside</i>). I should
think she’d be ashamed to send it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>wrapping shawl</i>). I know that the missionaries
lead much simpler lives than we do so of course
they have more time.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Hand it to me and I’ll put it beside the overcoat.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Mrs. Hodges sent this dress of Clara’s.
(<i>Holds up dress.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> It’s rather fadey looking but there’s a lot of
wear in it yet.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> There’s a guimpe that goes with it, but when
I asked Clara for it, she said her mother said the guimpe
was too good to give away.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>examining dress</i>). It isn’t a bad quality
gingham and it could easily be boiled out and used for
a white dress. Wrap it up and hand it over, (<i>aside</i>).
If she is going to hold a farewell service over every last
thing that goes in the box, we’ll never get it packed.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Here’s Emmeline Miller’s red dress! (<i>holding
up shabby dress.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). O that dress! I don’t see how
she ever brought herself to part with it for she has worn
it years and years!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> The material isn’t so bad and it can be scoured,
and scrubbed and pressed and mended and it will look
quite respectable. (<i>Wraps dress and hands to Mrs. J.</i>)
I’m going to give this suit of Albert’s. Albert simply insists
that he will not wear it another day, and so I thought
it would do very well for the missionary’s son. (<i>Holds
up patched and worn suit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Well, I’m sure the missionary’s son will be
very thankful to get it. (<i>Places suit in box.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> I’m going to give these ties too. (<i>holds up
gaudy ties</i>). Two or three of them are new but Albert
is so fussy he won’t wear them. I’m afraid I’ve brought
him up to be too particular.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> I’m afraid you have, Louisa.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). I don’t know as he is any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
more fussy than anybody else’s boy. I like to see a boy
particular about what he wears. (<i>Folds ties and wraps
them.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>apologetically</i>). Well, don’t get mad, Louisa.
I was just agreeing with you. (<i>aside</i>). Isn’t she
a tinder-box when anybody mentions her boy!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Here’s a cape from Mrs. Winter. It’s warm,
but you can’t say much else about it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Why it will be just the thing for those cold
Montana winters. I think the missionary’s wife will be
glad to get it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>examining cape</i>). You see its some moth-eaten
and I was scared for fear it would get moths in
my house. I never have them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Well wrap it up quick, and I’ll tuck it in here
beside the other things. Why we are getting quite a box
full. (<i>Places package in box.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> I thought I would contribute this red wrapper.
It’s warm, even though it isn’t so good looking.
(<i>Holds up shabby wrapper.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> I’m sure that will be very useful. But what’s
that?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Miss Loomis has actually contributed her hat.
Isn’t it awful?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>hesitating</i>). Really Louisa, we can’t send
that! It’s terrible!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Miss Loomis would never forgive me if I
didn’t. I’d like to put it in the ash barrel though. (<i>Holds
up hat.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Let’s see it! (<i>examines hat</i>). Well, I suppose
if it were steamed and pressed and dyed and other
trimming put on, it wouldn’t be so bad. We’ll have to
put it in for a finishing touch.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>handing hat to her</i>). I am certainly thankful
that I will not see that hat in front of me in church
any more. Here’s some more newspapers, Martha, to
stuff in at the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>completes task by packing top of box firmly
with papers.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Now thank goodness, that’s done. Dear me,
it’s five o’clock and I must hurry home. I had no idea
it was so late.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>hospitably</i>). Can’t you stay and have supper
with us?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>rising and pinning on her hat</i>). O no, thank
you just the same.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>helping her on with coat</i>). Well thank you
very much for coming. I’m glad that <i>one</i> member of the
society was conscientious enough to help.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> (<i>drawing on gloves</i>). O I never shirk my
duty. Good-bye Louisa. Come and see me real soon.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> You come and see me. Thank you ever so
much for helping me.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. J.</i> Good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Good-bye, Martha.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>picking up papers and rearranging room</i>).
I suppose Martha thought it would have been absolutely
impossible for me to have packed that box by myself.
Well, thank goodness it’s done, and Amelia’s box is done,
and I’m about done, too. (<i>Seats herself wearily.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Mildred, swinging skates in one hand.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> Well, mother, you look about fagged out.
(<i>goes over to her mother, and smoothes her forehead</i>).
Is the rummage sale over?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Rummage sale? We were packing the missionary
box.</p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I hope the gifts will be appreciated.
I wish I were to get Miss Loomis’ hat, and Mrs.
Hodges’ dress, and a few other adornments.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>irritably</i>). Mildred, I am really too tired
to stand any nonsense. I have your Aunt Amelia’s box
all ready, and I’ve worried over that, for I know whatever
I send will be criticised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> (<i>continuing to smooth her mother’s hair</i>).
Well, I don’t see how they could possibly find fault with
those presents. Dad is always so liberal about that box,
but I know Aunt Amelia always finds faults with every
last thing we send. I should think though she would be
pleased with the waist I embroidered for her, and those
lovely handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> She won’t though.</p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> It was the limit though for Dad to go shopping
on his own account and buy Gladys a dress pattern
that I’d have given my eyes for, and fur gloves for Uncle
and a fur cap for Joe, and an embroidered dress pattern
for Aunt Amelia too. The saleswoman coaxed him into
getting those embroidered dress patterns, all right.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>irritably</i>). O your father always has some
foolishness about Amelia loving him because he is her
youngest brother. But the box is packed anyway, and
the expressman is to call in the morning the first thing.
I’ve just got to nail the cover on both boxes and mark
them.</p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). O let me do that mother. I’ve
been gallivanting with the girls out skating while you’ve
been working, and I feel ashamed of myself. Let me
do that little bit. (<i>coaxingly</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>gratefully</i>). Thank you, dear. I am tired
and my head aches, so I’ll go rest awhile if you will
finish up. Thank you ever so much, (<i>rises</i>). Be careful
you don’t spill ink.</p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> (<i>reassuringly</i>). O I’ll be careful all right.
You go rest.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Mrs. Banks.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mildred.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Now for the amateur carpentry!
Who says a girl can’t drive a nail? (<i>Hums a
tune as she nails the lid upon first box.</i>) There, Mrs.
Missionary! Your valuable donations are safe. Let us
hope that they may not be injured in transit! Now Aunt
Amelia, here’s something to complain about! (<i>takes up
cards</i>). O poor mother! She’s forgotten to put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
cards on the presents. Well, I can’t unpack the box
again, and I’m not going to worry her by telling her
that she forgot them. Uncle William will know that the
sash and embroidered dresses aren’t for him. (<i>nails
box</i>). Now for the marking. Let’s see how artistic I
can be! Mrs. William Worthington, Morningside Apartments,
524 W. 118th Street, New York. (<i>suddenly</i>). O
I wonder if that was the right box? (<i>hesitates</i>). O I’m
sure it was, I couldn’t make a mistake about anything
like that! Now for the other! (<i>repeats as she marks</i>).
Mrs. David Brown, Silver Creek, Montana. Now ladies,
for what you are about to receive may you both be truly
thankful!</p>

<h2>SCENE II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>Dorothy dusts room, while Mrs. Brown is
seated at table mending.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>mournfully</i>). Well, mother, it don’t look
much like Christmas with father and Rob away. I suppose
you are going to celebrate by mending, so I’ll get
out that old blue waist and see if I can patch it up to
look more respectable. (<i>Searches in mending basket and
brings out waist ... Holds it up to view.</i>) It’s pretty hopeless
though! (<i>satirically</i>). What a merry lively Christmas
it will be!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Things might be lots and
lots worse, daughter. Since your father had to be away,
I’m glad that Rob could keep him company, and we’ll
have a postponed Christmas when they come back.
Thread this needle for me, please. Your eyes are better
than mine. (<i>Dorothy threads needle.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>handing needle to her mother</i>). A postponed
Christmas is as cheerful as a warmed over pancake!
But let’s open the box instead of waiting for
father. He won’t care.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). I had planned to wait till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
came back but there may be something perishable in the
box.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Perishable! Everything perished long before
it reached us! Wait till I get the hammer and chisel
to open it.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Dorothy.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>sadly</i>). Poor Dorothy! How I would love
to have pretty, dainty clothes for her and how she would
enjoy them.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Dorothy with child’s shabby hat on head.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). This is the hat that was sent
last year, so do you wonder I am pessimistic about this
year’s box? (<i>Tosses hat into corner</i>). Well, now for
the opening, and I’ll be hopeful anyway.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Look out for your fingers!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). O I’m a fine amateur carpenter!
This lid was nailed on to stay, though! (<i>Removes
lid from box.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). Well, I never! Mother, mother,
put down that old mending and look here! (<i>Takes
mending from her mother.</i>) Did you ever see such a
lovely box!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>also surprised</i>). What a beautiful box!
Is it really meant for us?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Here’s the label all right. Mrs. David
Brown, and that’s you! Just see the holly! Isn’t it
Christmas-y? (<i>Places sprig of holly in her hair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>hesitating</i>). Hadn’t we better wait till your
father and Rob come?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>reproachfully</i>). Wait? O mother what
outrageous cruelty! Why my fingers just itch to open
those packages. There don’t seem to be any labels, but
we can guess at them. You take the first.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>takes parcel, unwraps and displays white
embroidered waist</i>). Isn’t that exquisite?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). Why, mother, you’ll look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
as pretty as a picture in it. Stand up and let’s see how
it looks on you. (<i>Holds up waist upon her mother.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Mother, you just look sweet. And now for
my turn. (<i>Takes parcels, unwraps, and holds up dress
with flowered sash.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>excited</i>). Why mother I never had any
thing like this in my life! It’s the first thing that I’ve
ever owned that didn’t look as if some one had worn it
till they were sick of it, first. I wish I could see it in
the glass. Who’s our fairy godmother?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Why the Ladies’ Aid Society of the Meadowbrooke
Church. Don’t you remember that they wrote,
saying that they were sending a box?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Well, this is surely some box! Now mother,
it’s your turn!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>unwraps sweater</i>). This must be for Rob!
How pleased he will be! I’ll wrap it up again.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> That may be Rob’s but I know I’m going
to borrow it sometimes! (<i>Tries on sweater.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Now it’s your turn to take a package.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> It’s just like Aladdin’s lamp. (<i>takes package</i>).
Now I wonder what this is? (<i>Opens box</i>). O
mother what lovely neckwear! It’s almost too dainty to
touch. That pale blue will look so pretty with your waist.
Did I ever see such a box!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>taking parcel</i>). I guess I am as excited as
you are about it, Dorothy. (<i>Opens package</i>). This scarf
must be for your father, and see, here are gloves to go
with it.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Then I am going to throw away those gloves
which you have mended and mended till they are nothing
but mends. (<i>Takes gloves from mending basket and
throws them in waste basket.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>reprovingly</i>). It doesn’t take you long to
learn to be extravagant!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>taking large package from box</i>). I wonder
what’s in this big one. The best way to find out is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to open it. (<i>Opens package and holds up eiderdown
robe.</i>) O mother, won’t this be nice for you, so warm
and comfy! You must try it on right away! (<i>Slips robe
over mother’s shoulders.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> I’ll enjoy this I know! Now for my turn.
(<i>Opens box of handkerchiefs.</i>) How dainty and pretty!
We’ll divide these, but you mustn’t lose one!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> My turn for the fairy gift box. (<i>Opens parcel.</i>)
A fur cap for Father! <i>Won’t</i> he be pleased!
(<i>Tries cap on.</i>) This looks nicely on me, but I mustn’t
be selfish!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> I should hope not, with all the lovely gifts,
that you have! (<i>Takes prettily decorated package.</i>)
Candy! Well, this is for everybody! I’ll just keep it
till father and Rob come back.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>reaching for it</i>). Perishable goods!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>firmly</i>). I know it will be perishable if I put
it where you can get it!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> (<i>resigned</i>). Well, I’ll be patient and wait.
Now I’ll put back father’s and Rob’s presents, and then
I’ll take some of this holly and decorate with it. Dear
me! We won’t recognize ourselves!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). I am going to write at once to
the Meadowbrooke ladies, and tell them what a beautiful
Christmas they have made for us.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I take back all I said about a blue Christmas,
and while you write <i>I’m</i> going to try on my new
clothes.</p>

for a little bit of Christmas decorating, with father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Joe both away. Maybe I’ll get a tumble, but it will be
in a good cause.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Marie, with tray.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> O Marie put your tray down and help me fix
up this place so it will look more like Christmas and less
like an apartment.</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> (<i>politely</i>). Yes, Miss Gladys, (<i>aside</i>). It is
a pleasure to see some cheerfulness. The madame! (<i>imitating</i>).
Marie, the coffee is weak, the rolls are cold, the
grapefruit is impossible! (<i>sets down tray</i>).</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> You hang a wreath in the window, and I’ll
fix this rope of green over the door. (<i>Marie and Gladys
arrange greens.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> Now that is something like.</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> Miss Gladys, I will remove the tray, for madam
would disapprove of it remaining here.</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>stepping down from chair</i>). Yes, and I
might put my foot in her blue and gold coffee cup, and
she would disapprove still more.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Marie with tray.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Mrs. Worthington.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>languidly</i>). Good morning, Gladys.</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Good morning, mother. Just
in time to open Aunt Louisa’s Christmas box.</p>

<p>(<i>Mrs. W. seats herself and takes up bottle of smelling
salts.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>listlessly</i>). I really am not interested especially
in your Aunt Louisa’s box. It is past my comprehension
why when she is a woman of such plain, not to
say plebeian taste, she and your uncle should enjoy a
comfortable income, when we are obliged to strive so
hard to keep up the appearance which our social position
demands.</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>calling</i>). Marie! Bring a screwdriver or a
nail file or something and we’ll open the box. Well,
mother, maybe Aunt Louisa economizes more than we do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but my definition is that economy is spending your money
in such a manner that you don’t get any pleasure out
of it.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> Thank you, Marie. Now let’s open the box.
(<i>Both try to pry up lid, and finally are successful.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> Now mother, brace up, there’s a nice lady,
and take some interest in your pretty gifts.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>carelessly</i>). Gladys, I have told you I am
too nervous to take an interest in anything today. (<i>changing
tone</i>). How shocking! Why your aunt has stuffed
the box with newspapers! Newspapers for packing
Christmas gifts! What execrable ignorance! Marie,
take them out quickly!</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> (<i>respectfully</i>). Yes madam. (<i>aside</i>). Madam
is not too nervous to take an interest now.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). O that’s a novelty mother. Holly
seals and red ribbon are monotonous.</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>taking out parcel, and unwrapping it</i>). O
how charming, mother! Here is a hat for me to wear
on Fifth Avenue! I’ll try it on!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>paralyzed with indignation</i>). O what can
your aunt Louisa be thinking of! To insult me in this
manner! That hat! How atrocious! Marie take it out
of my sight!</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> (<i>respectfully</i>). Yes madam. (<i>aside, holding
up hat to audience</i>). A charming token from the beloved
relatives!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>gasping</i>). Gladys! My smelling salts! It
is incomprehensible! What will your father say!</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>laughing</i>). He will say that it is exclusive
and that you won’t find another in New York like it.
(<i>unwraps parcel, and takes out moth-eaten cape</i>). This
is an evening wrap, which you can wear to the opera to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
evening. (<i>examining cape</i>). It looks as if the
moth family and their relatives had been having an informal
supper on this stylish garment.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> Gladys how can you laugh? I shall not recover
from this shock for a year!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> Marie, take that thing and tell the ashman
to give it to his poor relations!</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> (<i>respectfully</i>). Yes madam! (<i>aside</i>). Such
a charming wrap, I almost fear to touch it! (<i>carries it
gingerly</i>).</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> My dear brother is not forgotten I am glad to see! These
ties will cultivate a love of beauty.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> And my poor boy must be insulted too! Terrible,
terrible! (<i>uses smelling salts</i>).</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> Marie give these ties to your cousin, the
policeman that comes to call. He can wear them when
he is off duty.</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> Thank you for your kindness, Madam.
(<i>aside</i>). Alphonse wear ties like these? Never!</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>satirically</i>). Aunt Louisa remembers that
you are an invalid, and has sent this negligee (<i>hands
shabby eiderdown robe to her mother</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>in agitation</i>). Gladys, how you can laugh
at my poor health, is more than I can comprehend, and
why your Aunt Louisa should have chosen to make me
the target of her insults is more than I can understand.
Marie, give it to the rag man.</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> Yes madam. (<i>aside</i>). I fear he would not
accept it.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> Well, mother, brother and I are some targets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
too. Here’s a dress to wear to the Van Schuyler’s
tea, and here’s a very nifty suit for Rob. (<i>exhibits faded
gingham, and patched suit</i>). The gingham however is
a bit decollette, but it has the fashionable short skirt.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> I am mortified beyond expression that Marie
should witness this frightful scene. Marie!</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> What makes you subpoena her as a witness
then?</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Marie.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> You called Madam?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). Marie put these shocking
garments where I shall never see or hear of them again.</p>

<p><i>Marie.</i> Yes, madam.</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>rummaging in box</i>). Wait a minute Marie,
and save your steps. Here are a couple more offerings
that will need your kind care. (<i>unwraps shawl</i>). Dearest
mother, a fleecy shawl for your shoulders, to shield
you from the chill winds. (<i>attempts to place shawl about
her mother’s shoulders</i>).</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>screaming</i>). Gladys! Take it away. How
horrible! The thing isn’t a shawl, it’s a moth-hole!</p>

<p><i>Gladys.</i> (<i>continuing</i>). I feared that my dear father
was to be forgotten, but he too is remembered. (<i>holds
up overcoat</i>). An overcoat, neat but not gaudy, with a
pleasing openwork effect in the lining.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. W.</i> (<i>sinks back in chair</i>). I am overcome.
Marie, take these abominable things away. I shall never
recover from this shock, and I shall never forget this insult.
(<i>dries her eyes</i>). And I shall write your Aunt
Louisa at once and tell her in unmistakable language,
my opinion of her, in sending to me, to <i>me</i> a box evidently
intended for the almshouse!</p>

<p>(<i>As curtain rises, members of Ladies’ Aid Society

Mrs. Jenkins, being in the chair.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>President.</i> (<i>rapping upon table</i>). Will the meeting

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>wildly</i>). Where <i>is</i> my other rubber?
They were brand new last week, and—</p>

<p><i>President.</i> (<i>rapping again</i>). Ladies, will you <i>please</i>
come to order? We will open with the minutes of the
last meeting, and Miss Loomis, who acted as secretary
pro-tem, will read them.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>apologetically</i>). I didn’t have time
to copy them in the book, but I have them on a piece of
paper. (<i>rummages in bag</i>). I’m sure I brought them.
Here they are! (<i>reads</i>). Take one dozen eggs—Oh,
mercy no, that’s the recipe for angel cake. Wait till I
look again. (<i>takes crochet pattern from bag</i>). That’s
the pattern for lace that Brother Tom’s wife gave me.
(<i>Holds it up.</i>) It’s real pretty, isn’t it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Let me see it!</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>explaining</i>). You make a double
crochet, after you’ve chained twelve.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> Oh, that’s easy! I could pick that out
myself.</p>

<p>(<i>Other members endeavor to examine the crochet pattern.</i>)</p>

<p><i>President.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). Miss Loomis, we are waiting
for the minutes of the meeting.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>holding up paper</i>). O here they are!
I’ll read them!</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> The regular meeting of the Ladies’ Aid
Society was held on November tenth at the residence
of Mrs. Winter, seven members present, and the President,
Mrs. Jenkins, being in the chair. Minutes of last
meeting read and approved. Report of supper committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
read and approved. Proceeds of harvest supper,
seven dollars and thirty-five cents.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> We charged too much for that supper,
or we’d have made more money.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>sharply</i>). I don’t think we charged
too much considering the terrible price of food.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> (<i>irritably</i>). Well, I don’t like to work
my feet off for a measly seven dollars.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> (<i>rapping</i>). Ladies, will you please come
to order. Miss Loomis, continue with your report.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>nervously</i>). I lost my place. Let’s
see—</p>

<p><i>President.</i> (<i>to help her</i>). You were reading about
the harvest supper.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> O yes. It was voted to send a box to
Mrs. David Brown, committee to meet at the home of
Mrs. Banks, chairlady of the committee.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> There were only two of the society there.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> I was too busy to come, but I sent a
nice hat for the missionary’s wife.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> (<i>aside</i>). That terrible hat!</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Ladies, I must insist that you come to
order.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>worried</i>). Where’s that crochet pattern?
I can’t lose that!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>handing it to her</i>). Here you are. I
was just counting the stitches.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Miss Loomis, if you have finished your
report, we will hear a letter received by Mrs. Hodges,
our secretary, from Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> Yes, I guess that was all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>nervously</i>). Wait till I find my
glasses. (<i>rummaging in bag</i>). Here they are. (<i>Opens
letter.</i>)</p>

<p>“My Dear Friends: Words fail me when I try to express
my thanks for the beautiful box which you sent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>—”</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> Pleased, wasn’t she?</p>

<p>“My heart is too full to write, as I think of the wonderful
kindness which prompted you to send it.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). They ain’t usually so thankful.</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Ladies, please come to order, and let us
listen to the letter.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>continuing</i>). The beautiful dress for
my daughter. (<i>aside</i>). She meant that gingham of
Clara’s—Where was I—“The clothing for myself which
seems far too good for a missionary’s wife—”</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> Somehow that don’t just fit our box.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>continuing</i>). “The gifts for my
son and husband are most thankfully received. Believe
me dear friends, I am more than grateful for your kindness.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">“Yours very sincerely,</span><br />
“RUTH M. BROWN.”<br />
</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> Somehow I can’t quite figure that out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> Ours was a nice box, nice enough, but
she didn’t have no call to say quite so much.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> (<i>rising</i>). Ladies, I have here a letter
from my husband’s sister, Mrs. Worthington, which may
throw some light upon Mrs. Brown’s letter. Each Christmas
we send a box to Mrs. Worthington, and I have received
this acknowledgment for the gifts which we sent
this year. (<i>Opens letter.</i>)</p>

<p>“Louisa: I have just supervised the opening of a box,
which while directed to me was evidently destined for
the almshouse. In fact, I doubt whether the inmates of
the almshouse would have found the donations acceptable.
Beneath newspapers which formed the packing,
I found an article, which at first appeared to be a abandoned
birds’ nest, but which upon closer inspection was
evidently intended for a hat.”</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>aghast</i>). My hat! Why I paid five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dollars for that hat eight years ago and it was perfectly
good. A bird’s nest! My hat!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> (<i>calmly</i>). May I continue?</p>

<p>“There were a motley collection of ghastly neckties, a
tattered overcoat, a forlorn gingham—”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). That was a perfectly
good dress, only Clara said she wouldn’t wear it any
more!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> (<i>continuing</i>). “And other disreputable
apparel. I cannot understand the insult and assure you
that I deem it unwarranted and unpardonable. I need
hardly say that the garments were given to the rag man.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">“Your sister-in-law,</span><br />
“AMELIA WORTHINGTON.”<br />
</div>

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> What an awful letter!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>shocked</i>). I’m glad I haven’t relations-in-law
like that!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> It is evidently clear to you ladies, that
the labels upon the boxes were mixed, and the box for
my sister-in-law reached Mrs. Brown, while the missionary
box which we packed was sent by mistake to Mrs.
Worthington.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). To say that my hat was
a birds’ nest!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> And disreputable apparel!</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Ladies, will you come to order! I regret
of course that the mistake has been made, for doubtless
it places Mrs. Banks in a very embarrassing position.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> (<i>nervously</i>). Embarrassing is no word
for it. She was so mad, it showed in her handwriting.
(<i>Passes letter round for inspection.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>gently</i>). Well, there is one good side
to it. The missionary was pleased with her box, and I

<p><i>Mrs. Winter.</i> (<i>apologetically</i>). And I might have
taken time to mend the overcoat.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>firmly</i>). I make no apologies for my
hat!</p>

<p><i>President.</i> I suppose we could have fixed up the box
meant for the missionary with pretty wrappings, like we
do other peoples.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>rising</i>). Ladies, may I say a few
words?</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Mrs. Hodges has the floor.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> I think this has been a lesson to us,
although it has probably made a peck of trouble for
Mrs. Banks.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Banks.</i> That’s so!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> I think it shows us that our missionary
likes pretty things the same as we do.</p>

<p><i>Miss Loomis.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). That’s why I sent my
hat!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Hodges.</i> (<i>continuing</i>). And while I am sorry
that it has made trouble for Mrs. Banks, I can’t help
being glad that the missionary got the nice box, so I
would move that hereafter we make our missionary
Christmas boxes as nice as those we send our husband’s
relations.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Second the motion!</p>

<p><i>President.</i> It is moved and seconded that hereafter
we make the boxes we send to our missionaries as good
as those which are intended for our husband’s relations.
All in favor say “Aye.”</p>

<p><i>All.</i> (<i>heartily</i>). Aye!</p>

<p><i>President.</i> Opposed? It is unanimously carried.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THIS play was produced professionally
for several seasons under another title,
and is now released for amateur production
without royalty and without restrictions
of any kind. The scenery and costumes
are simple. Time, about two hours. A
young society girl plays an important part
in overthrowing a corrupt political boss
and brings about the election of her
fiance. The race for the hand of a
wealthy widow by rival suitors furnishes
the comedy. A pretty story is unfolded,
but without actual love-making or any
scenes objectionable to the amateur.
Recommended for high schools and dramatic
clubs.</p>

<p>“<b>I CAN’T DO A THING WITH MY HAIR SINCE IT’S WASHED.</b>”

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
